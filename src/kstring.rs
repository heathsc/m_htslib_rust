/// A clone of kstring from htslib. This used libc::malloc for allocation and is designed to
/// be interoperable with htslib, so that KString instanes made in Rust can be used, modified and freed
/// in C and visa versa. Unlike CString (which it resembles as it works with u8 rather than char), it is mutable 
/// so can be resized and data can be pushed to it. When a KString is changed (by pushing more characters or
/// by truncating etc.), it is guaranteed that there is one and only one zero contained in the string, and that
/// is at the end. In this way, we can convert it efficiently to/from a CStr.

/// it uses malloc rather than the standard Rust allocator.
